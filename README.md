# Fan-Voice-Ke by Jose Kupeka Muhlanga

## Introduction

Sometimes as a sports fan you can sometimes have ideas where your team should be heading , then
possibly have a healthy discussion with others about the same, with Fan-voice-ke we offer a
platform where one can write a article with regards to their Sport and sport team and others can
have a chance to comment of the same.

## Problem Statement

We have many sports and sometimes niche activities, and some of the fans have some things to say
about their sports and team, opinions that can unite a sports community or a group of fans to have a
healthy discussion with regards to the same . Their opinions can come from a place of love in the
sport and can help the sport/team improve.
While social media can be a good platform to do so, it tends to spiral off into a convoluted mess
whereby conversations or discussions can end up into territories of abuse or asinine remarks. Thus
there will be a tendency where others in the sport or team to disregard opinions on social media
which in turn can create a real disconnect between the sport/team.
This is where Fan-Voice-Ke comes in, where we can offer a platform for fan opinions in the form
of articles and give the ability to other fans to rank the other authors while also being involved with
the conversation
